# OCELL Flutter Coding Interview

Flutter project for the coding interview

## Getting Started

Your task is to write a simple todo app. The app comes with a rough scaffold as well as some basic data classes for the https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ API.

* Fill the todo tap with todos from the api
* Fill the users tap with users from the api
* Fill the Posts app with posts
* Show users where we know the userId
* Create details pages for Todos and Posts
* Add local persistance for created posts
* Add filtering for todos
* Add option to add a new todo with provider (No persistance - with provider?) 
* Add some tests

Let's code!
